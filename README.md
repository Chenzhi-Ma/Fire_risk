Building fires remain a critical public safety concern, threatening lives, property, and infrastructure within cities globally. Despite substantial investments in fire safety, significant disparities in fire risk persist in urban landscapes across the U.S., underscoring the need for a holistic, data-driven strategy to reduce vulnerabilities. Here, we present an extensive analysis of U.S. building fires, integrating over one million fire incident reports with a novel synthesis of community-level data, encompassing socioeconomic indicators, building inventories, weather conditions, and incident-specific fire characteristics. Our work yields two pivotal contributions: a comprehensive framework that systematically traces fire risk from occurrence to consequence, and a novel city-level fire risk ranking system for U.S. cities. By systematically tracing fire occurrence and its consequences, we uncover structural, environmental, and social drivers that disproportionately endanger urban communities with older infrastructure and economic disadvantages. Our findings reveal that community-level factors, including outdated buildings and socioeconomic disparities, magnify both the frequency and severity of fire incidents. Incident-specific features, such as ignition sources and locations, further shape fire spread and injury outcomes, with buildings equipped with detectors and automatic extinguishing systems showing markedly lower risks. Lower-risk cities, where the fire incident rate can be as low as 1/3 of that of high-risk cities, tend to exhibit more favorable socioeconomic conditions and a higher prevalence of buildings equipped with fire safety measures compared to high-risk cities.
These insights provide a data-driven foundation for policy design, offering avenues for fire safety mandates, optimized resource allocation, and evidence-based interventions. By pinpointing high-risk communities and targeting critical vulnerabilities, this framework supports strategies that mitigate fire hazards, protect underserved populations, and foster more resilient cities.
